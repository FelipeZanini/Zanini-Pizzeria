## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

  - At the beginning of my journey through this project I was very unused to the Django language, I had to learn more topics while I was doing the project, relying with a lot of help in web forum, but since I got  hang of, it was easy to write my code, the biggest problem is this project was the deployment to Heroku, it took me more than 4 days to solve all the errors that I was facing, such as bad requests, broken links etc, but I decided to user Cloudnary for my page images and White Sound for my static files, since I made that decision everytinh flowed as expected.
